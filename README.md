# SkypeAdvertRemover
Removes all those pesky advertisements from Skype

As of Skype Version 7.40.0.103, This still works to remove the Ads.

Seriously, this will do that.

## How to use:  
1) Download the file from Release  
2) Make sure Skype is already closed (It will be closed forcefully when you run the program)  
3) Run the program (It will take a split second, and tell you it's done.)  
4) Congratulations, the advertisements have been removed!
